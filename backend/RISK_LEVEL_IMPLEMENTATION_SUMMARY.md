# Risk Level Implementation Update Summary

## Overview
Updated the EUNOIA system's risk level classification logic to use **ONLY overall_score** for determining risk levels in `assessments_42items` and `assessments_84items` tables, removing the previous dimension-based override logic.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Risk Classification Logic
**File:** `backend/utils/ryffScoring.js`
- **Removed:** Dimension-based override logic that classified students as 'high' risk if ANY dimension was at-risk
- **Updated:** `determineRiskLevel()` function now uses ONLY overall_score thresholds

### 2. Risk Level Thresholds (Unchanged)
**42-item Assessments:**
- `≤111`: high risk
- `112-181`: moderate risk  
- `≥182`: low risk

**84-item Assessments:**
- `≤222`: high risk
- `223-362`: moderate risk
- `≥363`: low risk

### 3. Updated Existing Data
**Script:** `update_risk_levels_overall_score_only.js`
- Recalculated all existing risk_level values based on overall_score only
- **Result:** All assessments now correctly classified by overall_score thresholds

## Verification Results

### Test Results
✅ **All 6 test cases passed** (`test_overall_score_only_logic.js`)
- High overall scores with at-risk dimensions → Correctly classified as 'low'
- Moderate overall scores with at-risk dimensions → Correctly classified as 'moderate'
- Low overall scores → Correctly classified as 'high'
- Boundary cases tested and working correctly

### Current Data Distribution
**42-item assessments:** 16 total
- Low: 0
- Moderate: 16
- High: 0

**84-item assessments:** 6 total
- Low: 0
- Moderate: 6
- High: 0

### Service Integration
✅ **RiskLevelService verified** (`test_risk_level_service_updated.js`)
- Service correctly uses updated logic
- 22 assessments processed successfully
- All risk levels now based purely on overall_score

## Key Benefits

1. **Simplified Classification:** Risk levels now follow a straightforward overall_score-based system
2. **Consistent Logic:** No more complex dimension-based overrides
3. **Predictable Results:** Risk level can be determined directly from overall_score
4. **Maintained Thresholds:** Existing score thresholds preserved for consistency

## Files Modified

1. `backend/utils/ryffScoring.js` - Updated `determineRiskLevel()` function
2. `backend/update_risk_levels_overall_score_only.js` - Data migration script
3. `backend/test_overall_score_only_logic.js` - Verification tests
4. `backend/test_risk_level_service_updated.js` - Service integration test

## Impact

- **Assessment Tables:** `assessments_42items` and `assessments_84items` now use overall_score-only classification
- **Other Tables:** No changes made to other tables as requested
- **Future Assessments:** Will automatically use the new classification logic
- **Existing Data:** All updated to reflect new classification system

## Conclusion

The risk level classification system has been successfully updated to use **ONLY overall_score** for determining risk levels in the assessment tables. The dimension-based override logic has been completely removed, and all existing data has been updated to reflect the new classification system.
