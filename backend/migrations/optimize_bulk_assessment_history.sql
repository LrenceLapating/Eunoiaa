-- Migration: Optimize bulk assessment history performance
-- This adds composite indexes to dramatically improve query performance

-- Composite index for bulk_assessments history queries
-- Optimizes filtering by counselor_id, status, assessment_type and ordering by created_at
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_bulk_assessments_history_lookup 
ON bulk_assessments(counselor_id, status, assessment_type, created_at DESC);

-- Composite index for assessment_assignments stats queries
-- Optimizes counting assignments by bulk_assessment_id and status
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_assessment_assignments_stats_lookup 
ON assessment_assignments(bulk_assessment_id, status);

-- Add comment to document the optimization
COMMENT ON INDEX idx_bulk_assessments_history_lookup 
IS 'Optimizes bulk assessment history queries by counselor with filtering and sorting';

COMMENT ON INDEX idx_assessment_assignments_stats_lookup 
IS 'Optimizes assignment statistics aggregation for bulk assessment history';
