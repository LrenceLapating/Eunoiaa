AT RISK DIMENSIONS: ${atRiskText}
HEALTHY DIMENSIONS: ${healthyText}
MODERATE DIMENSIONS: ${moderateText}

FORMAT:
Overall Mental Health Strategy:
[Write a comprehensive 4-5 sentence analysis of their overall well-being. VARY YOUR OPENING - don't always start with the score. You can begin with their strengths, challenges, or overall psychological state. Include the overall score (${Math.round(overallScore || 0)} out of ${overallMaxScore}) naturally within your analysis, not necessarily first. CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS: 
1. You MUST explicitly mention and celebrate the healthy dimensions by name if any exist in the HEALTHY DIMENSIONS list above. Say something like "You demonstrate healthy levels in [list the healthy dimensions]" or "Your psychological strengths shine in [healthy dimensions]".
2. You MUST explicitly mention the moderate dimensions by name if any exist in the MODERATE DIMENSIONS list above. Say something like "You show promising development in [list the moderate dimensions]" or "Areas where you're building solid foundations include [moderate dimensions]" - make this sound encouraging.
3. You MUST explicitly mention the at-risk dimensions by name if any exist in the AT RISK DIMENSIONS list above. Say something like "The areas requiring focused attention are [list at-risk dimensions]" or "Your growth opportunities lie in [at-risk dimensions]".
4. Do NOT mention any dimension status unless it appears in the respective lists above.
5. Make it detailed, personalized, and vary your language patterns for each student.]

Dimension Scores & Targeted Interventions:

Autonomy (${Math.round(subscales?.autonomy || 0)}/${dimensionMaxScore}): [VARY YOUR APPROACH - Don't always start with "Your score for Autonomy is...". Mix it up with different openings like: "In terms of autonomy, you scored ${Math.round(subscales?.autonomy || 0)} out of ${dimensionMaxScore}..." OR "Your autonomy assessment reveals a score of ${Math.round(subscales?.autonomy || 0)}/${dimensionMaxScore}..." OR "With ${Math.round(subscales?.autonomy || 0)} points out of ${dimensionMaxScore} in autonomy..." OR start with the psychological insight first, then mention the score. This places you in the ${this.getScoreStatus(subscales?.autonomy || 0, assessmentType)} range. Write ONLY what this score means about their inner experience and psychological state. NO advice. NO suggestions. NO "try" or "you could". Just describe their current psychological reality in this dimension.]

Personal Growth (${Math.round(subscales?.personal_growth || 0)}/${dimensionMaxScore}): [VARY YOUR APPROACH - Use different sentence structures and openings. Don't repeat the same pattern as autonomy. You could start with: "Personal growth-wise, your ${Math.round(subscales?.personal_growth || 0)}/${dimensionMaxScore} score..." OR "Your personal development journey reflects a score of ${Math.round(subscales?.personal_growth || 0)} out of ${dimensionMaxScore}..." OR begin with psychological insight. This places you in the ${this.getScoreStatus(subscales?.personal_growth || 0, assessmentType)} range. Write ONLY what this score means about their inner experience. NO advice. NO suggestions. Just describe their psychological state in this area.]

Purpose in Life (${Math.round(subscales?.purpose_in_life || 0)}/${dimensionMaxScore}): [VARY YOUR APPROACH - Use a completely different opening style from the previous two dimensions. Consider: "Regarding your sense of purpose, you achieved ${Math.round(subscales?.purpose_in_life || 0)} points out of ${dimensionMaxScore}..." OR "Your purpose in life dimension shows ${Math.round(subscales?.purpose_in_life || 0)}/${dimensionMaxScore}..." OR start with meaning-making insights. This places you in the ${this.getScoreStatus(subscales?.purpose_in_life || 0, assessmentType)} range. Write ONLY what this score reveals about their inner sense of direction and meaning. NO advice. Just describe their psychological experience.]

Self Acceptance (${Math.round(subscales?.self_acceptance || 0)}/${dimensionMaxScore}): [VARY YOUR APPROACH - Create a unique opening different from all previous dimensions. Try: "When it comes to self-acceptance, your ${Math.round(subscales?.self_acceptance || 0)}/${dimensionMaxScore} score..." OR "Self-acceptance wise, you scored ${Math.round(subscales?.self_acceptance || 0)} out of ${dimensionMaxScore}..." OR lead with self-relationship insights. This places you in the ${this.getScoreStatus(subscales?.self_acceptance || 0, assessmentType)} range. Write ONLY what this score indicates about their relationship with themselves. NO advice. Just describe their current self-perception and acceptance.]

Positive Relations (${Math.round(subscales?.positive_relations || 0)}/${dimensionMaxScore}): [VARY YOUR APPROACH - Use another distinct opening style. Consider: "In the realm of relationships, your ${Math.round(subscales?.positive_relations || 0)}/${dimensionMaxScore} score..." OR "Your capacity for positive relationships is reflected in ${Math.round(subscales?.positive_relations || 0)} points out of ${dimensionMaxScore}..." OR begin with relational insights. This places you in the ${this.getScoreStatus(subscales?.positive_relations || 0, assessmentType)} range. Write ONLY what this score reveals about their social connections and relationship patterns. NO advice. Just describe their relational world.]

Environmental Mastery (${Math.round(subscales?.environmental_mastery || 0)}/${dimensionMaxScore}): [VARY YOUR APPROACH - Create the most unique opening yet. Try: "Your environmental mastery assessment of ${Math.round(subscales?.environmental_mastery || 0)}/${dimensionMaxScore}..." OR "Managing life's demands shows in your ${Math.round(subscales?.environmental_mastery || 0)} out of ${dimensionMaxScore} score..." OR start with competency insights. This places you in the ${this.getScoreStatus(subscales?.environmental_mastery || 0, assessmentType)} range. Write ONLY what this score indicates about their ability to navigate and control their environment. NO advice. Just describe their current mastery level.]
