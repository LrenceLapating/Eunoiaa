# Deprecation Warning Fix

## Issue
The `util._extend` deprecation warning appears in Node.js when using older dependencies that haven't been updated to use `Object.assign()` instead of the deprecated `util._extend()`.

## Warning Message
```
(node:xxxx) [DEP0060] DeprecationWarning: The `util._extend` API is deprecated. Please use Object.assign() instead.
```

## Root Cause
This warning is **NOT** causing the production login issues. It's just a warning from Node.js about deprecated API usage in one of the dependencies.

## Solution

### Option 1: Update Dependencies (Recommended)
Run these commands to update dependencies:

```bash
# Frontend
cd "Eunoia frontend"
npm update
npm audit fix

# Backend
cd ../backend
npm update
npm audit fix
```

### Option 2: Suppress the Warning (Temporary)
If updating doesn't resolve it, you can suppress the warning by adding this to your backend startup:

```bash
# In package.json scripts
"start": "node --no-deprecation server.js"
"dev": "nodemon --no-deprecation server.js"
```

### Option 3: Identify the Specific Package
To find which package is causing the warning:

```bash
node --trace-deprecation server.js
```

## Common Culprits
These packages often cause this warning:
- `node-fetch` (older versions)
- `form-data` (older versions)
- `tough-cookie` (older versions)
- Various Express middleware packages

## Impact
- **Production Login Issue**: NOT related to this warning
- **Functionality**: No impact on application functionality
- **Performance**: No performance impact
- **Security**: No security implications

## Priority
- **Low Priority**: This is a cosmetic warning only
- **Main Focus**: Fix the API configuration and CORS issues first
